The incomplete version of this application is viewable at http://www.buccieri.net/poker/login.php using admin:12345 (please be respectful)

This is an incomplete, improperly styled web-based application built using HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, and jQuery in Sept/Oct '15. The purpose of the application is to manage waiting lists for different poker games in a poker room as well as displaying the lists in the lobby of the poker room so poker players and poker room staff can see real-time waiting lists. The application was used by a local poker room for several months as an alternative to using a simple whiteboard at the front of the room to track their lists.

The final, fully functional and stylized version has unfortunately been lost in the Inter-abyss. This version does not (and likely never will) have aesthetically pleasing styles or be 100% functional as the "final" version did. MOST functioning code is still in the files but not all is properly configured (i.e. ban/unban IP, daily tournaments, marquee).

Functions of this application include(d):
Adding, removing poker Games, each with it's own unique list of players
Adding, removing, altering position of players within each separate list
Adding, removing, altering daily tournaments, jackpots, promotions, or other "news" items
Allowing players to register on the site and remotely add their names to desired lists
Administrator banning or unbanning players based on the IP of the remotely added name
